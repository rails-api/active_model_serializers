# ActiveModel::Serializers

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rails-api/active_model_serializers.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rails-api/active_model_serializers)

ActiveModel::Serializers brings convention over configuration to your JSON generation.

AMS does this through two components: **serializers** and **adapters**. Serializers describe which attributes and relationships should be serialized. Adapters describe how attributes and relationships should be serialized.

# MAINTENANCE, PLEASE READ

This is the master branch of AMS. It will become the `0.10.0` release when it's
ready, but it's not. You probably don't want to use it yet. As such, we recommend
that any new projects you start use the latest `0.8.x` version of this gem. This
version is the most widely used, and will most closely resemble the forthcoming release.

There are two released versions of AMS that you may want to use: `0.9.x` and
`0.8.x`. `9` was recently `master`, so if you were using master, you probably want
to use it. `8` was the version that was on RubyGems, so if you were using that,
that's probably what you want.

`0.10.x` will be based on the `0.8.0` code, but with a more flexible
architecture. We'd love your help.

Thanks!

## Example

Given two models, a `Post(title: string, body: text)` and a
`Comment(name:string, body:text, post_id:integer)`, you will have two
serializers:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :title, :body

  has_many :comments

  url :post
end
```

and

```ruby
class CommentSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :name, :body

  belongs_to :post

  url [:post, :comment]
end
```

Generally speaking, you as a user of AMS will write (or generate) these
serializer classes. By default, they will use the JsonApiAdapter, implemented
by AMS. If you want to use a different adapter, such as a HalAdapter, you can
change this in an initializer:

```ruby
ActiveModel::Serializer.config.adapter = ActiveModel::Serializer::Adapter::HalAdapter
```

or

```ruby
ActiveModel::Serializer.config.adapter = :hal
```

You won't need to implement an adapter unless you wish to use a new format or
media type with AMS.

If you would like the key in the outputted JSON to be different from its name in ActiveRecord, you can use the :key option to customize it:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :body

  # look up :subject on the model, but use +title+ in the JSON
  attribute :subject, :key => :title
  has_many :comments
end
```

In your controllers, when you use `render :json`, Rails will now first search
for a serializer for the object and use it if available.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])

    render json: @post
  end
end
```

In this case, Rails will look for a serializer named `PostSerializer`, and if
it exists, use it to serialize the `Post`.

### Built in Adapters

The `:json_api` adapter will include the associated resources in the `"linked"`
member when the resource names are included in the `include` option.

```ruby
  render @posts, include: 'authors,comments'
```

### Specify a serializer

If you wish to use a serializer other than the default, you can explicitly pass it to the renderer.

#### 1. For a resource:

```ruby
  render json: @post, serializer: PostPreviewSerializer
```

#### 2. For an array resource:

```ruby
# Use the default `ArraySerializer`, which will use `each_serializer` to
# serialize each element
render json: @posts, each_serializer: PostPreviewSerializer

# Or, you can explicitly provide the collection serializer as well
render json: @posts, serializer: PaginatedSerializer, each_serializer: PostPreviewSerializer
```

### Disabling the root element

If the adapter supports it, you can disable to root element.

#### 1. Disable root per render call in your controller

```ruby
render :json => @posts, :root => false
```

#### 2. Subclass the serializer, and specify using it

```ruby
class CustomArraySerializer < ActiveModel::ArraySerializer
  self.root = false
end

# controller:
render :json => @posts, :serializer => CustomArraySerializer
```

#### 3. Define default_serializer_options in your controller

If you define `default_serializer_options` method in your controller, all serializers in actions of this controller and it's children will use them. One of the options may be `root: false`

```ruby
def default_serializer_options
  {
    root: false
  }
end
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'active_model_serializers'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

## Creating a Serializer

The easiest way to create a new serializer is to generate a new resource, which
will generate a serializer at the same time:

```
$ rails g resource post title:string body:string
```

This will generate a serializer in `app/serializers/post_serializer.rb` for
your new model. You can also generate a serializer for an existing model with
the serializer generator:

```
$ rails g serializer post
```

The generated seralizer will contain basic `attributes` and
`has_many`/`belongs_to` declarations, based on the model. For example:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :title, :body

  has_many :comments

  url :post
end
```

and

```ruby
class CommentSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :name, :body

  belongs_to :post_id

  url [:post, :comment]
end
```

The attribute names are a **whitelist** of attributes to be serialized.

The `has_many` and `belongs_to` declarations describe relationships between
resources. By default, when you serialize a `Post`, you will get its `Comment`s
as well.

The `url` declaration describes which named routes to use while generating URLs
for your JSON. Not every adapter will require URLs.
