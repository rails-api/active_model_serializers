[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/rails-api/active_model_serializers.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rails-api/active_model_serializers) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/rails-api/active_model_serializers.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/rails-api/active_model_serializers) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/rails-api/active_model_serializers/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/rails-api/active_model_serializers)

# Purpose

The purpose of `ActiveModel::Serializers` is to provide an object to
encapsulate serialization of `ActiveModel` objects, including `ActiveRecord`
objects.

Serializers know about both a model and the `current_user`, so you can
customize serialization based upon whether a user is authorized to see the
content.

In short, **serializers replace hash-driven development with object-oriented
development.**

# Installing

The easiest way to install `ActiveModel::Serializers` is to add it to your
`Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "active_model_serializers"
```

Then, install it on the command line:

```
$ bundle install
```

#### Ruby 1.8 is no longer supported!

If you must use a ruby 1.8 version (MRI 1.8.7, REE, Rubinius 1.8, or JRuby 1.8), you need to use version 0.8.x.
Versions after 0.9.0 do not support ruby 1.8. To specify version 0.8, include this in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "active_model_serializers", "~> 0.8.0"
```


# Creating a Serializer

The easiest way to create a new serializer is to generate a new resource, which
will generate a serializer at the same time:

```
$ rails g resource post title:string body:string
```

This will generate a serializer in `app/serializers/post_serializer.rb` for
your new model. You can also generate a serializer for an existing model with
the serializer generator:

```
$ rails g serializer post
```

### Support for POROs and other ORMs.

Currently `ActiveModel::Serializers` adds serialization support to all models
that descend from `ActiveRecord` or include `Mongoid::Document`. If you are
using another ORM, or if you are using objects that are `ActiveModel`
compliant but do not descend from `ActiveRecord` or include
`Mongoid::Document`, you must add an include statement for
`ActiveModel::SerializerSupport` to make models serializable. If you
also want to make collections serializable, you should include
`ActiveModel::ArraySerializerSupport` into your ORM's
relation/criteria class.

# ActiveModel::Serializer

All new serializers descend from ActiveModel::Serializer

# render :json

In your controllers, when you use `render :json`, Rails will now first search
for a serializer for the object and use it if available.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
    render json: @post
  end
end
```

In this case, Rails will look for a serializer named `PostSerializer`, and if
it exists, use it to serialize the `Post`.

This also works with `respond_with`, which uses `to_json` under the hood. Also
note that any options passed to `render :json` will be passed to your
serializer and available as `@options` inside.

To specify a custom serializer for an object, there are 2 options:

#### 1. Specify the serializer in your model:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  def active_model_serializer
    FancyPostSerializer
  end
end
```

#### 2. Specify the serializer when you render the object:

```ruby
render json: @post, serializer: FancyPostSerializer
```

## Arrays

In your controllers, when you use `render :json` for an array of objects, AMS will
use `ActiveModel::ArraySerializer` (included in this project) as the base serializer,
and the individual `Serializer` for the objects contained in that array.

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :title, :body
end

class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
    render json: @posts
  end
end
```

Given the example above, the index action will return

```json
{
  "posts":
    [
      { "title": "Post 1", "body": "Hello!" },
      { "title": "Post 2", "body": "Goodbye!" }
    ]
}
```

By default, the root element is the name of the controller. For example, `PostsController`
generates a root element "posts". To change it:

```ruby
render json: @posts, root: "some_posts"
```

You may disable the root element for arrays at the top level, which will result in
more concise json. See the next section for ways on how to do this. Disabling the
root element of the array with any of those methods will produce

```json
[
  { "title": "Post 1", "body": "Hello!" },
  { "title": "Post 2", "body": "Goodbye!" }
]
```

To specify a custom serializer for the items within an array:

```ruby
render json: @posts, each_serializer: FancyPostSerializer
```

## Disabling the root element

You have 4 options to disable the root element, each with a slightly different scope:

#### 1. Disable root globally for all, or per class

In an initializer:

```ruby
ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_model_serializers) do
  # Disable for all serializers (except ArraySerializer)
  ActiveModel::Serializer.root = false

  # Disable for ArraySerializer
  ActiveModel::ArraySerializer.root = false
end
```

#### 2. Disable root per render call in your controller

```ruby
render json: @posts, root: false
```

#### 3. Subclass the serializer, and specify using it

```ruby
class CustomArraySerializer < ActiveModel::ArraySerializer
  self.root = false
end

# controller:
render json: @posts, serializer: CustomArraySerializer
```

#### 4. Define default_serializer_options in your controller

If you define `default_serializer_options` method in your controller,
all serializers in actions of this controller and it's children will use them.
One of the options may be `root: false`

```ruby
def default_serializer_options
  {
    root: false
  }
end
```

## Getting the old version

If you find that your project is already relying on the old rails to_json
change `render :json` to `render json: @your_object.to_json`.

# Custom MIME Types

If you're dealing in a custom MIME Type (say, `application/vnd.api+json` or
similar) and you want `ActiveModel::Serializers` to respond with the correct
Content-Type header, just pass the `Mime::Type` object to
`ActiveModel::Serializer.register_mime_type`. If you're registering custom MIME
Types in a Rails initializer, you'll want to make sure the type is registered
first, then send it to `ActiveModel::Serializers`.

```ruby
Mime::Type.register('application/flergle+json', :flergle)
ActiveModel::Serializer.register_mime_type(Mime::FLERGLE)
```

# Attributes and Associations

Once you have a serializer, you can specify which attributes and associations
you would like to include in the serialized form.

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :body
  has_many :comments
end
```

## Attributes

For specified attributes, a serializer will look up the attribute on the
object you passed to `render :json`. It uses
`read_attribute_for_serialization`, which `ActiveRecord` objects implement as a
regular attribute lookup.

Before looking up the attribute on the object, a serializer will check for the
presence of a method with the name of the attribute. This allows serializers to
include properties beyond the simple attributes of the model. For example:

```ruby
class PersonSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :first_name, :last_name, :full_name

  def full_name
    "#{object.first_name} #{object.last_name}"
  end
end
```

Within a serializer's methods, you can access the object being
serialized as `object`.

Since this shadows any attribute named `object`, you can include them through `object.object`. For example:

```ruby
class VersionSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attribute :version_object, key: :object

  def version_object
    object.object
  end
end
```

You can also access the `current_user` method, which provides an
authorization context to your serializer. By default, the context
is the current user of your application, but this
[can be customized](#customizing-scope).

Serializers will check for the presence of a method named
`include_[ATTRIBUTE]?` to determine whether a particular attribute should be
included in the output. This is typically used to customize output
based on `current_user`. For example:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :body, :author

  def include_author?
    current_user.admin?
  end
end
```

The type of a computed attribute (like :full_name above) is not easily
calculated without some sophisticated static code analysis. To specify the
type of a computed attribute:

```ruby
class PersonSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :first_name, :last_name, {full_name: :string}

  def full_name
    "#{object.first_name} #{object.last_name}"
  end
end
```

If you would like the key in the outputted JSON to be different from its name
in ActiveRecord, you can use the `:key` option to customize it:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :body

  # look up :subject on the model, but use +title+ in the JSON
  attribute :subject, key: :title
  has_many :comments
end
```

If you would like to add meta information to the outputted JSON, use the `:meta`
option:

```ruby
render json: @posts, serializer: CustomArraySerializer, meta: {total: 10}
```

The above usage of `:meta` will produce the following:

```json
{
  "meta": { "total": 10 },
  "posts": [
    { "title": "Post 1", "body": "Hello!" },
    { "title": "Post 2", "body": "Goodbye!" }
  ]
}
```

If you would like to change the meta key name you can use the `:meta_key` option:

```ruby
render json: @posts, serializer: CustomArraySerializer, meta: {total: 10}, meta_key: 'meta_object'
```

The above usage of `:meta_key` will produce the following:

```json
{
  "meta_object": { "total": 10 },
  "posts": [
    { "title": "Post 1", "body": "Hello!" },
    { "title": "Post 2", "body": "Goodbye!" }
  ]
}
```

If you would like direct, low-level control of attribute serialization, you can
completely override the `attributes` method to return the hash you need:

```ruby
class PersonSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :first_name, :last_name

  def attributes
    hash = super
    if current_user.admin?
      hash["ssn"] = object.ssn
      hash["secret"] = object.mothers_maiden_name
    end
    hash
  end
end
```

## Associations

For specified associations, the serializer will look up the association and
then serialize each element of the association. For instance, a `has_many
:comments` association will create a new `CommentSerializer` for each comment
and use it to serialize the comment.

By default, serializers simply look up the association on the original object.
You can customize this behavior by implementing a method with the name of the
association and returning a different Array. Often, you will do this to
customize the objects returned based on the current user.

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :body
  has_many :comments

  # only let the user see comments he created.
  def comments
    object.comments.where(created_by: current_user)
  end
end
```

As with attributes, you can change the JSON key that the serializer should
use for a particular association.

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :body

  # look up comments, but use +my_comments+ as the key in JSON
  has_many :comments, key: :my_comments
end
```

Also, as with attributes, serializers will check for the presence
of a method named `include_[ASSOCIATION]?` to determine whether a particular association
should be included in the output. For example:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :body
  has_many :comments

  def include_comments?
    !object.comments_disabled?
  end
end
```

If you would like lower-level control of association serialization, you can
override `include_associations!` to specify which associations should be included:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :body
  has_one :author
  has_many :comments

  def include_associations!
    include! :author if current_user.admin?
    include! :comments unless object.comments_disabled?
  end
end
```

You may also use the `:serializer` option to specify a custom serializer class and the `:polymorphic` option to specify an association that is polymorphic (STI), e.g.:

```ruby
  has_many :comments, serializer: CommentShortSerializer
  has_one :reviewer, polymorphic: true
```

Serializers are only concerned with multiplicity, and not ownership. `belongs_to` ActiveRecord associations can be included using `has_one` in your serializer.

## Embedding Associations

By default, associations will be embedded inside the serialized object. So if
you have a post, the outputted JSON will look like:

```json
{
  "post": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "New post",
    "body": "A body!",
    "comments": [
      { "id": 1, "body": "what a dumb post" }
    ]
  }
}
```

This is convenient for simple use-cases, but for more complex clients, it is
better to supply an Array of IDs for the association. This makes your API more
flexible from a performance standpoint and avoids wasteful duplication.

To embed IDs instead of associations, simply use the `embed` class method:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  embed :ids

  attributes :id, :title, :body
  has_many :comments
end
```

Now, any associations will be supplied as an Array of IDs:

```json
{
  "post": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "New post",
    "body": "A body!",
    "comment_ids": [ 1, 2, 3 ]
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can choose to embed only the ids or the associated objects per association:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :body

  has_many :comments, embed: :objects
  has_many :tags, embed: :ids
end
```

The JSON will look like this:

```json
{
  "post": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "New post",
    "body": "A body!",
    "comments": [
      { "id": 1, "body": "what a dumb post" }
    ],
    "tag_ids": [ 1, 2, 3 ]
  }
}
```

In addition to supplying an Array of IDs, you may want to side-load the data
alongside the main object. This makes it easier to process the entire package
of data without having to recursively scan the tree looking for embedded
information. It also ensures that associations that are shared between several
objects (like tags), are only delivered once for the entire payload.

You can specify that the data be included like this:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  embed :ids, include: true

  attributes :id, :title, :body
  has_many :comments
end
```

Assuming that the comments also `has_many :tags`, you will get a JSON like
this:

```json
{
  "post": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "New post",
    "body": "A body!",
    "comment_ids": [ 1, 2 ]
  },
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "what a dumb post", "tag_ids": [ 1, 2 ] },
    { "id": 2, "body": "i liked it", "tag_ids": [ 1, 3 ] },
  ],
  "tags": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "short" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "whiny" },
    { "id": 3, "name": "happy" }
  ]
}
```

You can also specify a different root for the embedded objects than the key
used to reference them:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  embed :ids, include: true

  attributes :id, :title, :body
  has_many :comments, key: :comment_ids, root: :comment_objects
end
```

This would generate JSON that would look like this:

```json
{
  "post": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "New post",
    "body": "A body!",
    "comment_ids": [ 1 ]
  },
  "comment_objects": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "what a dumb post" }
  ]
}
```

You can also specify a different attribute to use rather than the ID of the
objects:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  embed :ids, include: true

  attributes :id, :title, :body
  has_many :comments, embed_key: :external_id
end
```

This would generate JSON that would look like this:

```json
{
  "post": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "New post",
    "body": "A body!",
    "comment_ids": [ "COMM001" ]
  },
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "external_id": "COMM001", "body": "what a dumb post" }
  ]
}
```

**NOTE**: The `embed :ids` mechanism is primary useful for clients that process
data in bulk and load it into a local store. For these clients, the ability to
easily see all of the data per type, rather than having to recursively scan the
data looking for information, is extremely useful.

If you are mostly working with the data in simple scenarios and manually making
Ajax requests, you probably just want to use the default embedded behavior.

## Customizing Scope

In a serializer, `current_user` is the current authorization scope which the controller
provides to the serializer when you call `render :json`. By default, this is
`current_user`, but can be customized in your controller by calling
`serialization_scope`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  serialization_scope :current_admin
end
```

The above example will also change the scope name from `current_user` to
`current_admin`.

Please note that, until now, `serialization_scope` doesn't accept a second
object with options for specifying which actions should or should not take a
given scope in consideration.

To be clear, it's not possible, yet, to do something like this:

```ruby
class SomeController < ApplicationController
  serialization_scope :current_admin, except: [:index, :show]
end
```

So, in order to have a fine grained control of what each action should take in
consideration for its scope, you may use something like this:

```ruby
class CitiesController < ApplicationController
  serialization_scope nil

  def index
    @cities = City.all

    render json: @cities, each_serializer: CitySerializer
  end

  def show
    @city = City.find(params[:id])

    render json: @city, scope: current_admin, scope_name: :current_admin
  end
end
```

Assuming that the `current_admin` method needs to make a query in the database
for the current user, the advantage of this approach is that, by setting
`serialization_scope` to `nil`, the `index` action no longer will need to make
that query, only the `show` action will.

## Caching

To cache a serializer, call `cached` and define a `cache_key` method:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  cached  # enables caching for this serializer

  attributes :title, :body

  def cache_key
    [object, current_user]
  end
end
```

The caching interface uses `Rails.cache` under the hood.

# Design and Implementation

## Keep it Simple

ActiveModel::Serializers is capable of producing complex JSON views/large object
trees, and it may be tempting to design in this way so that your client can make
fewer requests to get data and so that related querying can be optimized.
However, keeping things simple in your serializers and controllers may
significantly reduce complexity and maintenance over the long-term development
of your application. Please consider reducing the complexity of the JSON views
you provide via the serializers as you build out your application, so that
controllers/services can be more easily reused without a lot of complexity
later.

## Performance

As you develop your controllers or other code that utilizes serializers, try to
avoid n+1 queries by ensuring that data loads in an optimal fashion, e.g. if you
are using ActiveRecord, you might want to use query includes or joins as needed
to make the data available that the serializer(s) need.
