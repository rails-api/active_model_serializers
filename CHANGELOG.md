# unreleased

* On Ruby 1.8, we now generate an `id` method that properly serializes `id`
  columns. See issue #127 for more.

* Add an alias for `scope` method to be the name of the context. By default
  this is `current_user`. The name is automatically set when using
  `serialization_scope` in the controller.

* Pass through serialization options (such as `:include`) when a model
  has no serializer defined.
