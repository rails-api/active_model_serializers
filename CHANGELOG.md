# UNRELEASED

* On Ruby 1.8, we now generate an `id` method that properly serializes `id`
  columns. See issue #127 for more.

* Add an alias for `scope` method to be the name of the context. By default
  this is `current_user`. The name is automatically set when using
  `serialization_scope` in the controller.

* Pass through serialization options (such as `:include`) when a model
  has no serializer defined.

# VERSION 0.7.0

* ```embed_key``` option to allow embedding by attributes other than IDs
* Fix rendering nil with custom serializer
* Fix global ```self.root = false```
* Add support for specifying the serializer for an association as a String
* Able to specify keys on the attributes method
* Serializer Reloading via ActiveSupport::DescendantsTracker
* Reduce double map to once; Fixes datamapper eager loading.

# VERSION 0.6.0
