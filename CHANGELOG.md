# UNRELEASED

# VERSION 0.8.1

* Fix bug whereby a serializer using 'options' would blow up.

# VERSION 0.8.0

* Attributes can now have optional types.

* A new DefaultSerializer ensures that POROs behave the same way as ActiveModels.

* If you wish to override ActiveRecord::Base#to_Json, you can now require
  'active_record/serializer_override'. We don't recommend you do this, but
  many users do, so we've left it optional.

* Fixed a bug where ActionController wouldn't always have MimeResponds.

* An optinal caching feature allows you to cache JSON & hashes that AMS uses.
  Adding 'cached true' to your Serializers will turn on this cache.

* URL helpers used inside of Engines now work properly.

* Serializers now can filter attributes with `only` and `except`:

  ```
  UserSerializer.new(user, only: [:first_name, :last_name])
  UserSerializer.new(user, except: :first_name)
  ```

* Basic Mongoid support. We now include our mixins in the right place.

* On Ruby 1.8, we now generate an `id` method that properly serializes `id`
  columns. See issue #127 for more.

* Add an alias for `scope` method to be the name of the context. By default
  this is `current_user`. The name is automatically set when using
  `serialization_scope` in the controller.

* Pass through serialization options (such as `:include`) when a model
  has no serializer defined.
