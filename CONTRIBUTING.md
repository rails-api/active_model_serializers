## Have an issue?

Before opening an issue, try the following:

##### Consult the documentation

See if your issue can be resolved by information in the documentation.

- [0.10 (master) Documentation](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/tree/master/docs)
  - [![API Docs](http://img.shields.io/badge/yard-docs-blue.svg)](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rails-api/active_model_serializers/v0.10.0.rc5)
  - [Guides](docs)

- [0.8 (0-8-stable) Documentation](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/tree/0-8-stable)

##### Check for an existing issue

Take a look at the issues to see if a similar one has already been created. If
one exists, please add any additional information that might expedite
resolution.

#### Open an issue

If the documentation wasn't able to help resolve the issue and no issue already
exists, please open a new issue with the following in mind:

- Please make sure only to include one issue per report. If you encounter
  multiple, unrelated issues, please report them as such.
- Be detailed. Provide backtraces and example code when possible. Provide
  information about your environment. e.g., Ruby version, rails version, etc.
- Own your issue. Actively participate in the discussion and help drive the
  issue to closure.
- If you resolve your own issue, please share the details on the issue and close
  it out. Others might have the same issue and sharing solutions is helpful.

- Squash your commits and regularly rebase off master.
- Provide a description of the changes contained in the pull request.

#### Running tests

Run all tests

`$ rake test`

Run a single test suite

`$ rake test TEST=path/to/test.rb`

Run a single test

`$ rake test TEST=path/to/test.rb TESTOPTS="--name=test_something"`

Run tests against different Rails versions by setting the RAILS_VERSION variable
and bundling gems.  (save this script somewhere executable and run from top of AMS repository)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

rcommand='puts YAML.load_file("./.travis.yml")["env"]["matrix"].join(" ").gsub("RAILS_VERSION=", "")'
versions=$(ruby -ryaml -e "$rcommand")

for version in ${versions[@]}; do
  export RAILS_VERSION="$version"
  rm -f Gemfile.lock
  bundle check || bundle --local || bundle
  bundle exec rake test
  if [ "$?" -eq 0 ]; then
    # green in ANSI
    echo -e "\033[32m **** Tests passed against Rails ${RAILS_VERSION} **** \033[0m"
  else
    # red in ANSI
    echo -e "\033[31m **** Tests failed against Rails ${RAILS_VERSION} **** \033[0m"
    read -p '[Enter] any key to continue, [q] to quit...' prompt
    if [ "$prompt" = 'q' ]; then
      unset RAILS_VERSION
      exit 1
    fi
fi
  unset RAILS_VERSION
done
```
